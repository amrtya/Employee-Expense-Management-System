<img src="https://github.com/iamneowise/employeeexpensemgmtapp-react-FS_Team_159/blob/main/Images/User%20Dashboard.png" width="800">

An Expense Management System is a web app through which a company can automate the process of the employee expense reimbursement process. This web app reduces the need for paper, lowers the amount of time spent handling expenses and minimizes errors.

### Employee

This is the page of the Employee where he/she can add his/her expenses. Not only can he add expense, he can also edit the expenses. He can also have a full description of the Expense on clicking the card of an expense. An Employee cannot delete an expense. An Employee can have upto Rs. 5000 of reimbursement.
