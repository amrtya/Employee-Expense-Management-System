<p>Two ways to get in to the web app are
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Login</h3><img src="https://github.com/iamneowise/employeeexpensemgmtapp-react-FS_Team_159/blob/main/Images/Login.PNG" /></li>
    <li><h3>SignUp</h3><img src="https://github.com/iamneowise/employeeexpensemgmtapp-react-FS_Team_159/blob/main/Images/Signup.PNG" /></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>The expense management web app is built for the usage by three classes of employees
  <ul>
    <li>Users</li>
    <li>Managers</li>
    <li>Admin</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Authorities of an User</h1>
<h2>DashBoard</h2>
<p>In the dashboard, an user can check their expenses segregated into approved and non-approved according to the month they choose.</p>

<h2>Add Expense Page <strong>[/add-expense]</strong></h2>
<p>In the add expense page an user can add an expense, while it also displays all the previous expenses added by that user. The ones which are already approved/reimbursed are marked in green</p>
<p>Clicking on each of the expenses will open a separate modal displaying all the details of that particular expense</p>
